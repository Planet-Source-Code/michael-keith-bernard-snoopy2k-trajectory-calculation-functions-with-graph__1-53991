### Description

NOW WITH GRAPHING CAPABILITIES - I have been wanting to write a game like Cannons or Bang Bang for a while now, and haven't been able to find strong, simple, and correct calculations for ballistic trajectory. So, with a little search on Google.com, I found a few sites that show and explain the basics of ballistic trajectory calculations. I then transcribed the information i needed from the mathmatical libraries to code. All of the functions are broken down into very simple and uniform chunks. It is also in a single, easy to read module. Included is a simple example of how to utilize the functions inside the module. I hope this can help someone with aspirations like mine. Questions or comments can be directed to be via e-mail at martianman2001@hotmail.com
